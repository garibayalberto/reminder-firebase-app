Note: the secrets.js file is referenced in the index.js file. The reason for this is that the file contains sensitive information regarding my personal firebase account. 

If you would like to connect your own please look at the secrets.js_example file. Feel free to rename it to "secrets.js" and modify the contents to pull from your firebase project.
